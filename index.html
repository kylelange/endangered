        <a><img src="../img/cheetah.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The cheetah has a wide range and is found from Africa south of the Sahara to India. It is considered the world's fastest mammal on land reaching speeds of up to 75 mph. Adults can reach up to 5 feet long and weigh up to 145 lbs. The tail can grow to be as long as 32 inches. It has a tawny brown coat with black spots, and black tear streaks across its cheeks, and its underparts are white.

        <a><img src="../img/numbat.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The numbat is a marsupial and is also called the banded anteater. This animal is unique because it belongs to its own family, and unlike many other marsupials it is mainly active in the day instead of night. The numbat has a reddish-brown coat with white stripes on its back. There is a dark bar that crosses its eye from its ear to its snout. It has a long head and bushy tail.</p>

      <div class="whale">
        <a><img src="../img/blue-whale.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The blue whale is the largest of all whales and is said to be the largest animal in Earth's history. Blue whales are blue to blue-gray and may sometimes appear to have a faint yellow skin color because of the many microorganisms that accumulate on their bodies as they travel through colder waters. Blue whales prefer cold waters and open seas and prefer not to venture near coastal areas. The blue whale eats mostly krill (small shrimp-like crustaceans) by using its baleen plates lining its mouth to sieve krill from the water.</p>

      <div class="gray-wolf">
        <a><img src="../img/gray-wolf.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The gray wolf is the largest of the canines and can reach a weight of 80 lb and 5 to 6.5 feet in length. It can live for up to 13 years. In the eastern woodlands, the gray wolf is also known as the "timber wolf," and in the arctic, the gray wolf is sometimes called the "arctic wolf." In the tundra, the gray wolf is sometimes called the "tundra wolf." The gray wolf has a gray fur coat with long tawny-colored legs, a narrow chest, and tawny-colored flanks. Males are larger than females. The gray wolf can reach up to 45 mph in a short sprint but can also run up to 25 mph for several miles. They have an excellent sense of smell and hearing.</p>

      <div class="chinchilla">
        <a><img src="../img/chinchilla.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>Chinchillas are found in the Andes in South America and are hunted for their fine fur. Unfortunately, this subspecies (only found in Bolivia) is possibly extinct or in danger of extinction in the near future. The fur of the chinchilla is soft and dense because each of the many follicles that have 60 fine hairs that grow from them. Short-tailed chinchillas prefer mountain grassland habitat where they make their dens in rock crevices. They are active mainly at night, only emerging at dusk and dawn to bask in the sun</p>
